# How to build a real time chat room using Firebase Firestore

__Google’s Cloud [Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/) is a NoSQL document database that allows users to create serverless applications.__

We can use [Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/) with its NoSQL database structure (collections, documents and properties) to build synchronize real time data without writing a line of server code.

## Experiment

I've created this [simple live chat room](https://github.com/diogorodrigues/labs/tree/master/real-time-chat-js-firebase) using just JS (without frameworks) to test some Firestore features. ✨😁✔
