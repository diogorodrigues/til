Created by [Francesco Cirillo](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/francesco-cirillo), it's  a renowned time-management tool used by millions of people all over the world.

Focusing on process, not product, it helps us stay focused on tasks that require long periods of concentration. It's really important avoid procrastination during the proccess.

### General Rules

* A Pomodoro can’t be interrupted; it marks 25 minutes of pure work.
* A Pomodoro can’t be split up; there is no such thing as half of a Pomodoro or a quarter of a Pomodoro.
* If a Pomodoro is definitively interrupted by someone or something, that Pomodoro should be considered void, as if it had never been set; then you should make a fresh start with a new Pomodoro.
* You are not allowed to keep on working “just for a few more minutes” even if you’re convinced that in those few minutes you could complete the task at hand.
