# TypeORM is an ORM that can run in NodeJS

__Working on NodeJS applications I've found [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/), an advanced object-relational mapping.__

> TypeORM is definitely the most mature Object Relational Mapper (ORM) available in the node.js world. Since it's written in TypeScript, it works pretty well with the Nest framework.

I'm creating a project using NodeJS API that is powered by a PostgreSQL database (docker image) for data storage and using TypeORM to make my life easier as a developer. :)

To start the adventure with this library I had to run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

`yarn add typeorm pg -D`

Cheers
