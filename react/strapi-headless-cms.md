# Strapi headless CMS

__[Strapi](https://strapi.io/) is the leading open-source headless CMS. Itâ€™s 100% Javascript, fully customizable and developer-first.__

Using Strapi is really super easy, since it's built on top of React. With just only one [command with yarn/npx](https://strapi.io/documentation/v3.x/installation/cli.html#step-2-create-a-new-project) we can start a new project using this amazing headless CMS (we access its content using an API and it doesn't care about how and where its content gets displayed).

```
yarn create strapi-app my-project --quickstart
```

## Advantages of using headless CMS

It doesn't matter where you will display the content. The CMS will provide the API and you can use it anywhere.

- Build a website with a technology you are familiar with
- Freedom from developing the legacy software of tomorrow
- Ability to easily manage content on multiple channels: web (React, Vue, Angular...), static site generators (Gatsby, Jekyll...), native mobile apps (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, React Native...)
- Content management from a single place across the organization.

## Why Strapi

- Open source - free and open-source, forever.
- 100% JavaScript
- RESTful or GraphQL
- Extensible by design - plugins system included. 
- Authentications & Permissions - secure your endpoints by allowing or not allowing users to access your API by role.
