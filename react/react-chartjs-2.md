# Creating charts with react-chartjs-2

__[Chart.js ](https://www.chartjs.org/) is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for creating charts and there is a version for React called [react-chartjs-2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2).__

I was looking for a simple chart library to do some testing on React when I found this library and I am very impressed with the ease of implementing it. Chart.js has built-in support for tooltips, animation and pretty good support for responsiveness. 

About my experiment, I took advantage of these quarantined days to create a [**CoronaVirus tracker**](https://github.com/diogorodrigues/covid-19-tracker-reactjs "CoronaVirus tracker") using react-chartjs-2 and [this api](https://covid19.mathdro.id/api "this api"). 

You can also [check other examples of this library here](https://github.com/jerairrest/react-chartjs-2).
