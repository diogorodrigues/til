# üìù til - Today I learned

Working as a front-end developer and web designer, every day I come across many new technologies and different techniques. So, to keep up to date and learn about all the amazing things that happen on the Web, I am going to use this repository to take little notes and do brief experiments.

If you see something interesting, feel free to learn it too.

Let's go!
